Hello!

I have never written Ruby before but played around with getting a function, script to run it, and test working.

So far it is quite fun!

To run the script:

```
ruby flat_array_script.rb [1,2,4,6,[1,2,5,[2],6],3]
```

The array can be replaced with any nested array!

To run the test

```
ruby flat_array_test.rb
```
